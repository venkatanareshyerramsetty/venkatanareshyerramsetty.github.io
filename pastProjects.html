Soon that became a reality through a proper dining hall for the girls. It was an emotional moment to all of us when this facility was dedicated during 2017, in  the name of our colleague late Smt. Indira.  That little support and satisfaction was, 
                            in a way, kept our group intact and aligned our thought process more towards such causes.

                            <span class="pl-5"></span> Going to hospital for getting the treatment for the nearones is a herculean task for the villagers. They travel miles to the city for better medical care for both emergency as well as long term ailment.  Having come to unknown place, shelter for the caretakers is a big problem, with many spending their nights sleeping under trees and pavements or corridors of the hospital. RIMS hospital premises is no exception. It just flashed to our association that something needs to be done in our way to give back to the town which was a shelter to all of us for four prime years of our education.
                            What would be a better deed than lending a helping hand through providing attendant shelter. Our friends in the region, made a cost effective plan, engaged with a contractor relentlessly, monitored the progress through multiple visits and finally made it a reality. It was inaugurated in 2018  by the director RIMS who applauded our cause. Dedicated to our colleague late Smt. Supriya,  it was yet another moment of immense satisfaction to all of us.

When the World had to locked down in March 2020 to arrest the infection the agony grew for several sections of the people who are poor and dependent on daily income. The State and Central Governments announced several relief measures and donations were accepted through CM Relief and PM relief funds. Due to the Govt and WHO guidelines any direct help to the needy was uncertain hence to offer our immediate support we made contributions to AP CM and TS CM relief funds along with PM relief fund.
